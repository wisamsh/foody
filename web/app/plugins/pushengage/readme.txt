ðŸ¤© Send personalized web push notifications on autopilot. 10x your repeat traffic and WordPress site engagement with push notification campaigns. ðŸš€

== Description ==

===  ===

<a href="https://www.pushengage.com/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">PushEngage</a> is the #1 push notification plugin in the world. Itâ€™s a marketing plugin that helps you get more web push notification subscribers, increase sales, and grow your business.

With PushEngageâ€™s web push notifications, you can turn your website visitors into regular readers, loyal fans, and repeat customers. The coolest part is that it only takes your subscribers two clicks or less to get subscribed to your notifications.

PushEngage gives you a simple, easy-to-use dashboard that helps you create optins, launch web push campaigns, grow your subscriber base, track your revenue goals, and manage your audience using advanced segmentation and audience targeting rules.

Using the PushEngage dashboard, you can even add custom call to action (CTA) buttons. The buttons have many of our customers dramatically increase their click-through rates (CTR).

You also get advanced analytics to track your performance metrics with or without using third-party tools such as Google Analytics.

We also offer mobile popup modals so that your marketing messages will always look great on all devices (mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop). Weâ€™re constantly working to improve the opt-in prompts as well. In fact, weâ€™re the only push notification service that can integrate seamlessly with a web popup builder to offer a better user experience.

Along with the absolute best web push notification software in the market, you also get a top-tier Customer Success team to help you get more success from your push notifications more often.

Itâ€™s super easy to create highly targeted and personalized push messages with our easy campaign creator.

If youâ€™re looking for advanced automation, you can use the push API to serve use cases that your competitors arenâ€™t even thinking of!

The best part is the PushEngage plugin connects directly with the web app and installs the service worker on your site automatically unlike any other push notification service. Just in case youâ€™re not a developer, the service worker is a JSON file that allows you to collect push notification subscribers.

=== The PushEngage Dashboard Makes it Easy ===

We were tired of the push notification software that in the market that are too difficult to use and are built for developers instead of business owners. Thatâ€™s why we built PushEngage to help you create powerful marketing workflows and custom web push notification campaigns even without a developer.

With PushEngage, you can create powerful marketing campaigns from a simple dashboard in a matter of minutes even if:

* Youâ€™re not a developer and donâ€™t know how to use code to send push notifications
* Youâ€™ve never used push notifications before and you have no idea where to start
* You tried another push notification software and hated the experience

But donâ€™t just take our word for it. Hereâ€™s what Amanda had to say:

> Itâ€™s uber-easy to use, the support team is helpful, and the results are impressive. Especially when you take into account how little work they are to build and send. Highly recommend PushEngage to anyone wanting a way to reach customers thatâ€™s fast, reliable, and effective.<br>

=== Time-Tested Push Notification Campaign Templates ===

Donâ€™t know what push notification campaigns you need and how to get started?

No worries. We built campaign templates into our dashboard that you can use to get started.

The technical stuff is all taken care of. All you have to do is:

* Select a campaign type
* Create your push notifications
* Select an audience to send to
* Send/Schedule your campaign

Even with <a href="https://www.pushengage.com/automated-push-notifications/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">advanced trigger campaigns</a>, you can start with a template that comes with pre-built triggers so that you donâ€™t have to configure them yourself. All you have to do is focus on growing your business.

=== Smart Page Targeting and Behavior Based Personalization ===

All PushEngage popup modals come with advanced page targeting and behavior based personalization.

This means you can <a hre="https://www.pushengage.com/how-to-add-a-push-notification-subscription-button-to-popups/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">show a custom popup</a> for:

* A specific page or set of pages of your site
* Different website visitors based on their geolocation
* Users who click a specific link

And more!

You can even segment your subscribers automatically when they visit your site. PushEngage allows you to create <a href="https://www.pushengage.com/how-to-do-segmentation-in-push-notifications/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme" rel="friend">custom segmentation rules</a>.

=== Advanced Analytics and A/B Testing ===

Unlike other WordPress push notification plugins, PushEngage comes with reliable A/B split testing and accurate analytics without slowing down your site. Most other plugins face significant issues with caching that can skew your web push campaign analytics and A/B tests.

But PushEngage offers far better infrastructure for more accurate results. You get detailed analytics on all your campaigns and optins right from your dashboard.

Whatâ€™s more is that you can create Intelligent A/B tests to improve an ongoing campaign.

With Intelligent A/B testing, you can select a small audience to split test your browser push notifications and then send the winning notification to the rest of your audience.
